          <h1>Our Founding Philosophy</h1>
          <h2><em>TIMBUKTU</em> was founded on the belief that technology should be understood, not intimidating. We believe that computer technology, when understood and applied intelligently, possesses the ability to be the solution in all and every field of work. From STEM to the humanities, computer technology will be, if not already, become part of everyone's life. With so much progress already made so far in the field of computer science, a new innovation is created exponentially sooner than the last. With all this progress being made, we find ourselves unsure of how far this technology can go, if there are any limits to this technology, and if we should acknowledge said limits. I ask then, why not accept the inevitable with confidence and ambition, to take on the challenge today of learning all there is to know about computers and their capabilities? My experience thus far has taught me that allowing a capacity for curiosity, a growth mindset, and creating a plan to put that passion to work is the best way of putting yourself in charge of how this technology will be utilized and improved upon for today and tomorrow's solutions. Thus, I take it upon myself to command this company to do just that, everyday. We know that those who share ambitions for learning, growth, and control of computer technology to change their lives will find that myself and our team share that same goal, and will pursue it as high-performance as possible.
